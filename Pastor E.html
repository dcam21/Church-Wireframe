<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="color:#bf052d"><span style="font-family:goudy old style,garamond,big caslon,times new roman,serif">Anointed by God Jameson Eichelberger is a vessel being used as a mouth piece of God to speak prophetic revelation and hope into people everywhere no matter the gender, nationality or religious affiliation.&nbsp; However, before his conversion he lived a destructive lifestyle and was an upcoming recording gangster rap artist. In his music career he, opened up for secular artists such as Triple Six Mafia, Pastor Troy, and Ghetto Mafia.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="color:#60213f"><span style="font-family:goudy old style,garamond,big caslon,times new roman,serif">He thought that was his destiny but the Lord had another assignment. The Lord saved and baptized him in the Holy Ghost, what a testimony to hear from tragedy to triumph. The testimony will invoke change and confer hope to the listener. By God's mercy and grace&nbsp; this young man was delivered&nbsp;from a destructive lifestyle which altered his life's course. Psalms 40:2 declares, "He brought me up also out of a horrible pit. Out of the miry clay, and set my foot upon a rock and established my goings. Then, the Lord spoke to him what an amazing visitation from the&nbsp;Lord to hear from the man of God. The Lord said to him I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="color:#60213f"><span style="font-family:goudy old style,garamond,big caslon,times new roman,serif">The Lord has given him a very uncommon ministry of teaching, preaching and the demonstration of the spirit of God in accordance with Mark 16:17. He is described as "passionate, powerful, electrifying, prophetic and anointed." &nbsp;With this unique ability and gift he's recognized as one of the emerging voices in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; However, his assertion is he simply loves Jesus and realizes&nbsp; his existence is only because of God's love, mercy and grace. He has traveled in the U.S. and internationally devoted to ministering the word of God.</span></span></span></p>
